# AoC2023

My submissions for the Advent of Code challenge

My first time.
<br>
I'm going to use *javascript*.

### Impressions after Day 3

The puzzles are taking a lot longer than I expected per puzzle. But that is good if my goal is to get faster by practicing every day.

I was ambitious at first and wanted to not only solve the possibles, but do a Web app animation of the solving in progress for each one.
So far I haven't had the time to do one of those each day.

My errors are mostly Off-By-One errors or copy and paste errors like parsing with a split by ';' then split each part by ',' but forgetting to change the ';' to a ',' when I copy paste the outer loop code to 'save typing'
